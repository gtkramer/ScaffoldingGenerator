# Scaffolding Generator

Scaffolding Generator is a 3D printing application that generates the
scaffolding required to support an object during production.  The motivation
behind Scaffolding Generator is purely academic with the purpose of learning
the complexities of the 3D printing problem via exploration in programming.

The project aims to incorporate the following technologies, data structures,
tool chains, or specifications:

* Interval tree (for indexing edges on triangles)
* KD tree (for indexing vertexes)
* OpenGL 4.5 (for rendering an object)
* ANTLR (for writing grammars that parse STL files)
* xUnit and Moq (for testing)
* Avalonia (for user interface)

Motivation for implementation choices:

* Use modern build and test systems
* Learn interesting aspects of computing
* Separate user interface from logic
